# Zone Configuration
# Unified format for single and multi-camera setups

# Format: cameras -> zones structure
# Each camera has its own set of zones with independent coordinates

cameras:
  camera_1:
    name: "Camera 1 - Main Entrance"
    stream_url: "udp://127.0.0.1:1905"  # Optional: for reference only
    zones:
      zone1:
        name: "Assembly Area"
        # Polygon coordinates relative to this camera's frame
        polygon:
          - [100, 100]
          - [400, 100]
          - [400, 300]
          - [100, 300]
        authorized_ids: [1]  # Duong (ID: 1)
      
      zone2:
        name: "Packaging Area"
        polygon:
          - [450, 100]
          - [750, 100]
          - [750, 300]
          - [450, 300]
        authorized_ids: [2]  # Khiem (ID: 2)
      
      zone3:
        name: "Common Area"
        polygon:
          - [100, 350]
          - [750, 350]
          - [750, 500]
          - [100, 500]
        authorized_ids: [1, 2]  # Both Duong and Khiem allowed

# Notes:
# 1. For single camera: Use camera_1 only
#    Zone IDs will be: zone1, zone2, zone3 (no camera prefix)
#
# 2. For multi-camera: Add camera_2, camera_3, etc.
#    Zone IDs will be: camera_1_zone1, camera_2_zone1, etc.
#
# 3. Camera order must match stream URL order in detection
#    Example: If you pass "udp://127.0.0.1:1905, udp://127.0.0.1:1906"
#    Then camera_1 = first stream, camera_2 = second stream
#
# 4. Coordinates are relative to EACH camera's frame
#    - Camera 1: (0,0) to (width, height) of camera 1
#    - Camera 2: (0,0) to (width, height) of camera 2
#    NOT relative to the combined/stitched frame!
#
# 5. Each camera can have different number of zones
