# This is an example showing how to configure zones for multiple cameras

cameras:
  camera_1:
    name: "Camera 1 - Main Entrance"
    stream_url: "udp://127.0.0.1:1905"  # Optional: for reference only
    zones:
      zone1:
        name: "Assembly Area"
        polygon:
          - [100, 100]
          - [400, 100]
          - [400, 300]
          - [100, 300]
        authorized_ids: [1]  # Duong (ID: 1)
      
      zone2:
        name: "Common Area"
        polygon:
          - [100, 350]
          - [400, 350]
          - [400, 500]
          - [100, 500]
        authorized_ids: [1, 2]  # Both allowed
  
  camera_2:
    name: "Camera 2 - Packaging Area"
    stream_url: "udp://127.0.0.1:1906"  # Optional: for reference only
    zones:
      zone1:
        name: "Packaging Area"
        polygon:
          - [450, 100]
